#Natural Language Processing
'''
Natural Language Processing refers to the application of 
computational techniques to the analysis and synthesis of natural 
language and speech for a machine.
''' 

#Bag of Words is one of the most popular algorithm used in Natural Language Processing

'''
Natural Language Toolkit library is the library which is provided
by scikit learn to do NLP on datasets.
